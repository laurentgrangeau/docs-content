<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
  - You have [configured your API keys](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/)
  - You have installed a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your local computer
  - You have installed [Apache Ant]()

</Message>

The officiel [AWS SDK for the Java programming language](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/) is called `aws-sdk-java`. It allows to interact with any S3-compatible Object Storage solution using custom endpoints.

## Downloading the AWS SDK for Java

Download and unpack the [latest version](https://sdk-for-java.amazonwebservices.com/latest/aws-java-sdk.zip) of the AWS SDK for Java:

  ```
  wget https://sdk-for-java.amazonwebservices.com/latest/aws-java-sdk.zip && unzip aws-java-sdk.zip
  ```

  <Message type="tip">

  You can install the AWS SDK for Java also using [Apache Maven](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-project-maven.html)

## Communicating with Scaleway Object Storage using the Java SDK

<Message type="important">

Make sure your AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`) exists and your [your API keys](/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/)] are configured as in the following example: 

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>
aws_secret_access_key=<YOU_SECRET_KEY>

```
1. Open the file `aws-java-sdk-*/samples/AmazonS3/S3Sample.java` in a text editor of your choice.

2. Edit the lines to configure the S3 endpoint for your bucket:

  ```java
          AmazonS3 s3 = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard()
            .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(credentials))
            .withRegion("us-west-2")
            .build();
  ```

  as follows:

  ```java
          AmazonS3 s3 = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard()
            .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(credentials))
            .withRegion("us-west-2")
            .endpointOverride(URI.create("https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud"))
            .build();
  ```

  <Message type="note">

  The endpoint URI depends of the geographical location of your bucket. It can either be: 

  * `fr-par.s3.scw.cloud` for buckets located in Paris, France
  * `nl-ams.s3.scw.cloud` for buckets located in Amsterdam, Netherlands
  * `pl-waw.s3.scw.cloud` for buckets located in Warsaw, Poland
